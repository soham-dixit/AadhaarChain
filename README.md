## AadhaarChain

### ✅ Overview

This project aims to address the challenges in the Aadhaar updation and enrollment process for Indian citizens by leveraging Web3 blockchain technology. The system involves two key entities: Aadhaar holders (Indian citizens) and service masters. The process is automated and secured through the use of Solidity language for smart contract development, Scroll Chain network for deploying the smart contract, and Anon-Aadhaar for validating Aadhaar authenticity without compromising user data.

### ✅ Technology Stack

1. **Solidity Smart Contract:**
   - The smart contract, developed in Solidity, governs the rules and processes of Aadhaar updation and enrollment on the blockchain.

2. **Scroll.io Network:**
   - Scroll Chain is the chosen blockchain network for deploying and executing the smart contract. It provides the necessary infrastructure for a secure and decentralized application.
   - Contract address of our project: 0x7Bdf1Af327b9BB9FbF89C8fd96fBa51EA556ab28
   - Link to Scroll-etherscan: https://sepolia.scrollscan.com/address/0x7Bdf1Af327b9BB9FbF89C8fd96fBa51EA556ab28 

3. **Anon-Aadhaar SDK:**
   - Anon-Aadhaar is utilized for Aadhaar validation. It verifies the Aadhaar signature locally on the user's machine, ensuring authenticity without transmitting sensitive data to external servers.

4. **Flutter for Android Application:**
   - The Android application is developed using the Flutter framework, providing a user-friendly interface for both Aadhaar holders and service masters.

### ✅ Problems Encountered

1. **Limited Resources for Web3 in Flutter:**
   - The project faced challenges due to the scarcity of resources and documentation for implementing Web3 technology within Flutter applications. This led to additional effort in integrating blockchain functionalities.

2. **Flutter SDK Issues:**
   - Issues were encountered with the Flutter Software Development Kit (SDK), creating obstacles during the development phase. Addressing these SDK-related problems required thorough troubleshooting and workarounds.

3. **Resource Scarcity for Flutter:**
   - Finding relevant resources and documentation for Flutter development was challenging. This posed difficulties in optimizing the application and leveraging Flutter's capabilities to the fullest.

### ✅ Solutions

1. **Collaboration and Community Support:**
   - Engage with the Web3 and Flutter communities to seek assistance, share experiences, and collaborate on solutions to challenges faced during the integration process.

2. **SDK Version Management:**
   - Regularly check for updates and manage Flutter SDK versions to ensure compatibility and address any known issues. Refer to official Flutter documentation and community forums for guidance.

3. **Documentation Enhancement:**
   - Contribute to and promote the development of comprehensive documentation for integrating Web3 in Flutter applications. This can help future developers facing similar challenges.
